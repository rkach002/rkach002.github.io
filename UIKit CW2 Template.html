        The year is 1978. In the sweltering California heat, you turn on the TV, crack open a 2-litre chilled plastic bottle of fizzy pop and sing along the jingle 'Have a Coke and smile', thanking whoever came up with the idea of putting drinks in plastic bottles that you can now easily store. Life is good. Fast forward to forty years later, and what felt like a great idea back then is now one of the worst things to happen to our planet. Literally.

        A bulk of these bottles are made of PET single-use plastics that are not recycled and end up being dumped in the oceans along with all the other human junk, filling it with toxins and damaging the marine biodiversity.

      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12575298"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p> We of course have read all about it in schools. We know the consequences of our untamed consumption. But to many the threat of a dying ocean is still distant and not one that needs to be rushed. Who afterall has sleepless nights over some whales inhaling plastics in a far off ocean, right? </p>

        <p> But what many do not grasp, is that the ocean produces half the oxygen in the world and we would literally all die with the ocean's demise. The plastic pollution has already affected earth's major marine areas. The amount of plastic going into the ocean every year (up to 23m tonnes) weighs as much as ten times all the blue whales alive today.</p>

        <iframe title="Quantity of plastic in major marine areas 2019" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-hg7bZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hg7bZ/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="349" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

        <p> The North Pacific and Indian Oceans, as shown above, each have 1900 to 1300 pieces of plastics dumped in them. This almost corresponds with the fact that the countries that produce most plastic waste like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1236969/single-use-plastic-waste-generation-worldwide-by-country/"> China, America, India, Japan and the UK </a> are in the periphery.</p>

        <p> Sure consumerism has got us here to an extent, but are we entirely the ones to be blamed? For years we have been subject to advertising that has told us we want these things even if we don't need them. It's everywhere on the billboards around us. The sporting events we watch, the music we listen to, the movies we enjoy in the theatres have all subtely or overtly been the vehicles of the propaganda machine for the plastic polluters.</p>

        <img src="./UIKit CW2 Template_files/cocacola4.jpg">

        <p> Having a coca cola is a sign of hapy times, because some thouands of miles away creatives came up with catchy slogans. We bought into it, not minding the fact that a single bottle of that PET plastic bottle will take about 450 years to decompose. You could watch everything on Netflix 95 times over in that much time!</p>


        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8334406"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p> The Coca Cola company has long been one of the worst plastic offenders along with Pepsico and Nestle. Until 2020, it was producing about three million tonnes of plastic waste, and its head of sustainability stated <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51197463"> that year </a> that the company will continue using single use plastic bottles until 50% of these are produced using recycled material by 2030. But Coca Cola hasn't delivered to its promises in the past, and as per one <a href = "https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/2022/02/is-coca-colas-latest-promise-really-a-step-forward/"> report </a> by Plastic Soup Foundation has constantly revised their targets without meeting them. It's claim in 1990 to use an average of 25% of recyclates in its PET bottles was fulfilled only to the extent of 10% until recently. </p?

        <P> And yet, the brand value of Coca Cola remains undefeated. </p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12575875"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p> Coca Cola's revenue, while having plummeted in recent years, was still standing at 38.65 billion U.S. dollars in 2021. </p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12576445"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p> One of the key contributing factors in this revenue is the amount spent by the company on marketing and advertising to build a brand image that is attractive and even benevolent. Remember the recent 'Share-a-Coke' campaign? Great for camaraderie, bad for the environment. Every year millions of dollars are spent on these campaigns, giving these plastic polluting products the visibility and  market presence they need. The company spends roughly 4 billion US dollars in advertising every year (except in 2020 when it was 2.8 billions), much higher than its competitor Pepsico. </p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8336224"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p> The money is pumped into a variety of advertising channels, from outdoor banners to TV commercials and does not even include its brand integrations in successful pop culture properties like Stranger Things. It has sponsored key sporting events like the Olympic Games to music shows like the Coke Studio to (ironically) the Cop27 climate meet up in 2022.</p>

         <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/8279329"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

      <p> Early this year, Coca Cola announced they will only use bottles made of recycled plastic in the US and UK, a major step in their attempt to be more sustainable. Their "World Without Waste" campaign, launched in 2018, claims that by 2030, the company will collect and recycle all the bottles and cans sold by them.

    </p><p> Critics, however, point out it is too little too late, and with these steps the company is seeking to greenwash its image. Questions are being raised about the safety of using these recycled plastic bottles to store food items as they can contain harmful toxic chemicals. <a href="https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/coca-cola-sued-for-false-advertising-over-sustainability-claims/"> The company was in fact recently sued </a> for claiming to be more eco-friendly.

    <p> Then there is also the fact that the Coca Cola Company, like Pepsico, Unilever, Nestle and Exxonmobil, donates millions of dollars to NGOs around the world that the environmentalists believe help them in their greenwash propaganda. </p>

            <p> “Coca-Cola has long been in the business of portraying itself as stewards of the environment while pointing to consumers as the source of plastic pollution. But it is Coca-Cola, not consumers, that chooses to use chart-topping amounts of plastic for its products. It is time this company is held accountable for deceiving the public” </p>

<P> Beyond sporting events and charities, the company has also contibuted funds for political campaigns in certain countries. Between 2018 to 2021, it paid thousands of dallars to senate and house representatives in the US, like the California governer Gavin Newsom. The repercussion of this can be seen in the bills opposed by the beverage maker that do not get passed, like the Soda Bill Tax. </p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/12577577"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p> It is estimated that by 2040, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1270092/plastic-waste-treatment-and-disposal-projections-worldwide/"> 29 million metric tons </a> of plastic waste will flow into our oceans while over 54 million metric tons will be dumped in the landfills. Many countries like the United States, that currently has the recycling rate of just 28%, are lagging behind in their sustainable goals. With the impending crisis, this level of plastic pollution is unsustainable and it is only in the hands of the corporates like the Coca Cola and Exxonmobil, and the governments to do something that can really be effective.

        </p><p> Our individual recycing effects and opting for a minimalistic life while being a step in the direction, is far from making an impact. So what stops leaders from taking a tough stance against these offenders? - they are good for the economy! Their money powers their football matches, their movie promotions, their music festivals. In countries like the USA, offenders like Exxonmobil also donate generous amounts to the political parties. It is a circle of apathy, with common folks like us in the centre, left to bear the ordeal of living in a plastic hell. Like Douglas Adams once said in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:

        </p><blockquote>
            <p> “This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy” </p>
        </blockquote>

        But atleast we got some cool ad jingles to humm and films for the Cannes Lions Awards when we drown in the plastic tsunami!
